            <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saves my life</h2>

            <p><strong>I used to be pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
            <p>Things wew terrible. I had a job I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

            <h3>How I turned things around.</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I litterally out 90% of my possession in the garbage , sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
            <p>It wasn't wasy at all, but everything around me was in a bad place. I didn't know what else to do. And it worked</p>

            <h3>Now I live simple life</h3>
            <p>How that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p>With how much ut turned my life around. <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>. and how others can benefit fromo living a simple life</p>
